{"name":"Sylva Lynn","tagline":"Indy Web Developer for Hire","body":"### Hi there! I'm Sylva\r\nI live in Indianapolis, where I help individuals, small businesses, and non profits build their web presence. I'm currently studying javascript and building my first app as I transition into web development. I'm excited to have several different projects to divide my time and keep things interesting. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm not working on cool projects with inspiring people, you can catch me at a downtown yoga class, grabbing a traditional cappuccino, or walking my dog Rusty along the canal. \r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI'll add a list of previous work before the new year. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you're looking for a bright young lady ready to learn about your particular needs, drop me a line @sylvalynn\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
